A first attempt at a 2d game

## The Idea
To create a voice controlled, squad based game. All too often in movies and tv we see
someone sitting back at HQ with a radio and a live feed to their troops on the ground.
What I'd like to do is re-create that, using voice recognition, NLP, and some good ol'
2D animation. It'll be slow going with work (and soon enough, school), but I hope to 
organize this enough to be able to make some progress on weekends. 

## TODO:
#### Initially:
(X) set up project structure
#### Getting the Structure
( ) get starting with cocos
    ( ) implement a basic app
    ( ) add a simple moveable character
    ( ) add a simple scrolling map
( ) get started with wit
    ( ) add text entry box to app
    ( ) get character to respond to simple commands
#### Adding some Depth
( ) add animation
( ) add multiple characters
( ) create interaction and waypoints to map
#### Fleshing out the Game
( ) create simple bots
( ) give bots AI
( ) create game flow
